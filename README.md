# Top-5-Favorites-Showcase

In preparation for my Web Design class, which will cover
Grouping and Layouting elements on a webpage, I created this
project as an example to show to my students.

It makes use of HTML and CSS. The groupings were done through
<div> grouping tags. Also implemented are hover animations
with CSS
